# My Personal Configuration Files

## Liability
*__TLDR:__ Not my problem mate!*

Just my various configuration files. Take what you like, all of it or what you don't like, I don't care. If you get fired, make your computer smoke, cause the apocalypse or make a billion trillion currency I genuinely don't care. That's your problem have fun with it (alright if you end the world I will be a bit salty).
