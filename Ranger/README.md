# Ranger

For a terminal (and pretty much main) file manager I use ranger. Its a great, powerful and minimalistic program that makes the more complex file management loads easier.

## Theming

I use the [devicons](https://github.com/alexanderjeurissen/ranger_devicons) plugin to get nice icons based on the file-type before the filename.

### File Previews.

*I turned on pretty much all file previews possible. Still thinking about potential options for certain files. For example HTML files as page renders, text files as an actual preview of vim and album art for audio file. Unfortunately there isn't much info about this online so will have to figure it out myself.*
